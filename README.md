# Alex Lagarde SQL Portfolio 

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of my 
independent work in SQL, showcasing my skills in data manipulation, query
optimization, database design, and data analysis. As an analytical worker with a strong 
background in data science, I've included a variety of examples that demonstrate my 
ability to transform and interpret data effectively.
